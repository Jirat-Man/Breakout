2. <b>How to compile program</b>
   1. Create a maven project with the file
   2. Add javafx library to project structure
   3. configure the main class to "breakout.StartGameFx".
3. <b>Javadoc is in the javadoc folder at "src/javadoc"</b>
4. <b>Features that are working properly</b>
   1. Sound effect of ball hitting border/paddle/wall.
   2. Sound effect of button pressed.
   3. Sound effect of winning/losing.
   4. Background music.
   5. HighScore list.
   6. Sprite on game objects.
   7. Wall changing colour when it has been hit.
   8. background image in-game and on fxml.
5. <b>Features not implemented</b>
   1. PowerUp bricks(could not get it run).
   2. HighScore list in javaFx(could not get it to run).
6. <b>New Classes</b>
   1. "EndFrame": show game summary.
   2. More Brick classes so there are more variety of bricks.
   3. "MusicPlayer": play background music.
   4. "EffectPlayer": play effect sound.
   5. "SpriteSheet": crop buffered images for sprites.
   6. "StartGameFx": launch FXML file, play background music in Menu.
   7. "StageController": handle events on the stage.
7. <b>Modification</b>
   1. "Crack" class is removed because the cracks are invisible under the sprites.
   2. Basic Maintenance such as renaming classes to be more descriptive,   removing unused/redundant code, fixed bugs and spelling errors.
   3. Renamed everything to conform to the Bob's coding convention.
   4. Implemented encapsulation on all class variables and moved them to the top.
   5. Made sure code does not exceed 80 characters.
   6. Reduced number of parameters for methods that contain more than 5 parameters.
   7. Removed unused imports.
   8. Removed hardcoded variables in methods and define them as a final variable.
   9. Added Maven Framework.
   10. Created packages with suitable names for the classes.
   11. Deleted unused methods.
   12. Moved all images and mp3 files to a resource folder.
   13. Added Javadoc documentation.
   14. Added Module-info file.
   15. Added gitignore file to ignore file.
   16. Added test file to test for bugs.
8. <b>Challenges Encountered</b>
   1. Git: initializing the repo on git was challenging, pulling from git caused many problems, but learnt a lot about git and its importance for program development.
   2. Understanding the given code, never had to deal with such a big program. Learnt how to quickly understand new code, quicker to understand flow of the code.
   3. Swing: took extra time to learn swing,as I did not learn about it last year.(personally graphics were especially hard to understand).
   4. Launching JavaSwing from javafx.
   5. Launching javafx from javaSwing(could not do it)
9. <b>Things I am proud of</b>
    1. High-score list: Even though it is not in JavaFx, had to come up with tricky algorithm to make the highest score appear at the very top of the JTextArea.
    2. Music/SoundFx: Extremely hard to find working resources on playing sound in java.  But I managed to get it to work both in Swing and Javafx after many hours.
    3. SplashSheet: Cropping bufferedImage, making it move, and changing the image as an action happens.
    4. Launching JavaSwing form javaFx, many trail and errors, very rewarding when it successfully ran.
    5. Learnt so much about Program Development from this coursework, things that can't be learnt from youtube or lectures(too much to mention everything).  Little fixes and bugs that took hours to fix is now so rewarding because from now onwards   those fixes will take so much less time as I now understand more about coding in general. A lot of time spent but all is worth it.
